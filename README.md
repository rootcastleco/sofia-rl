 Overview
SofiaPilot AI is an advanced artificial intelligence engine designed for the Rootcastle NetFleet™ ecosystem. It ingests live or batch telemetry data (GPS, acceleration, braking, steering angle, engine load) from commercial vehicles and applies machine learning models to classify and score driver behavior.

Key capabilities include:

Real-time behavior scoring (aggressive driving, harsh braking, rapid acceleration, cornering)
Driver profiling for insurance, training, and logistics optimization
Predictive maintenance triggers based on driving style
Compliance monitoring against EU and Turkish fleet regulations
Integration-ready with existing NetFleet™ dashboard and API systems
SofiaPilot AI bridges the gap between raw vehicle data and actionable intelligence for fleet managers, insurance providers, and safety coordinators.
